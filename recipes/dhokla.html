    <h1>Dhokla</h1>
    <img src="../img/khaman-besan.jpg" alt="">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dhokla is a savoury sponge dish that is native to the Indian state of Gujarat and parts of adjacent states,[1] and is popular throughout the country. It is made with a fermented batter that is steamed to a cake-like consistency. The batter consists of a mixture of rice with the pulse Bengal gram,[2] but has several variants with the gram replaced by chickpeas, pigeon peas, or urad beans.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Mustard Seeds</li>
        <li>Sesame Seeds</li>
        <li>Cilantro</li>
        <li>Green chili</li>        
        <li>Gramflour</li>        
        <li>Semolina</li>
        <li>Turmeric</li>
        <li>Fruit Salt(Eno)</li>
        <li>Citric Acid</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To a mixing bowl, add water, sugar, salt, citric acid, ginger, green chili, and oil. Mix well until sugar dissolves. Keep aside.</li>
        <li>Now pour the spiced water and mix well to make a lump-free batter. If needed, add more water to make a free-flowing batter that is still slightly thick. (the water proportion can vary slightly based on the flour used). Whisk the batter in one direction for 1-2 minutes.</li> 
        <li>Check the consistency, it should not be too runny or too thick and should coat the back of the spoon. If it's too runny, add 1 tablespoon of besan at a time to reach desired consistency. If it is too thick, add 1 tablespoon of water at a time to reach desired consistency.</li>
        <li>Grease a 7-inch stainless steel bowl (in which you will make Khaman) with oil. I use one of the stackable containers that fit inside the Instant Pot. You can also use a 7-inch cake pan. </li>
        <li>To a deep pan (or the stainless insert pot of the instant pot), add 3 cups water and bring it to a boil on high heat. Place a trivet in the pan.</li>
        <li>Once the water starts bubbling, add ENO (or baking soda) to the batter along with 1 tablespoon of water. Eno will start to fizz and froth up. </li>
        <li>Whisk until everything is well mixed. Make sure to whisk around the edges too. The batter will increase in volume, and turn fluffy and lighter in color. You want to mix well but do not over-mix.</li>
        <li>Immediately transfer the fluffy khaman batter into the greased bowl. It is important that once ENO (fruit salt) is added, the steaming process should start immediately to get soft and spongy khaman dhokla.</li>
        <li>Place the bowl on a trivet in the steamer. Cover with a lid. Reduce the heat to medium and steam for 20 mins.</li>
